# DetMir

This repository contains my test job of parsing https://www.detmir.ru/
How spider works:
1. We reach starting page and retrive ids for targeted cities (in our case it's Moscow and Saint-Petersburg)
2. Make API requests to retrieve data
3. Put data into csv file
4. Done
All regions seem to have same amount of products though, maybe I'm wrong and won't get a job)
